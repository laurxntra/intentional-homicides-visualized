# Gendered Homicide Rates in Europe and Central Asia

## Overview
For this project, we explored a subset of the Global Bank Dataset to analyze how international homicide rates (per 100,00 people) differ between males and females in Europe and Central Asia. Our visualization highlights the overall trends over time, making it easy for viewers to quickly grasp patterns while providing interactive grasp patterns while providing interactive elements for deeper exploration
